### How to use 
1. You have a document in PDF scan. You can get its OCR-text. Upload the file and click **OCR**. You can set the language if needed.
2. You receive PDF with OCR (or you have a regular pdf with text conent). You want to translate it into russian. You can do this in two ways:
   1. Just klick **Translate (RU)**. But... It's not good idea because... Automatic translate is not very good: formulas, same else...
   2. You сan got original and translated document in one: page by page. Select *eng+rus* option in language and make a translate!
3. You may extract text for... I don't know for what purpose, but it might come in handy! Just do it with **Extract text** option.
4. For best quality, you can correct russian text with spellcheker (juamspell).
5. In last (on moment), you can upload image, that automatic converted to pdf for all operation with it!
